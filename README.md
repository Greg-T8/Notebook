# Welcome
This is my personal notebook. In the spirit of public learning, I use this notebook document my journey through technical certifications and systems administration.

I work for a Microsoft consulting company. Most of my learning caters to progressing my skills in Microsoft technologies, including Azure, Microsoft 365, and PowerShell.
