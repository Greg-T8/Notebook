# Welcome
This is my personal notebook. I intend to use this notebook to capture my learnings and knowledge of technical items in systems administration, web development, information security, and programming.  

I just started this notebook, so there's not much content here yet. I will be building out this notebook in the spirit of <strong>Public Learning</strong>.
