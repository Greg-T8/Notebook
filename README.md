# Overview

Welcome to my personal notebook! In the spirit of public learning I use this notebook as a central hub for my studies and explorations. In this notebook, I dive into a wide range of topics, including certifications, programming languages, tools, and technologies.

My skillset primarily revolves around the Microsoft ecosystem, including PowerShell, Azure DevOps, .NET, Azure, and Microsoft 365. However, I also work on things outside of Microsoft, including assembly language, C, GNU/Linux, and cybersecurity.
