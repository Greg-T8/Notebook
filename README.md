# Overview

Welcome to my personal notebook! In the spirit of public learning I use this notebook as a central hub for my studies and explorations. In this notebook, I dive into a wide range of topics, including certifications, programming languages, tools, technologies, and methodologies.

My technical skillset primarily revolves around the Microsoft ecosystem, including PowerShell, .NET, Azure, and Microsoft 365. However, I also work on things outside of Microsoft, including assembly language, C, Linux, and information security.
