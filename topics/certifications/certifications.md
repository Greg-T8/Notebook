# Microsoft Certification Page

I work for a Microsoft consulting company, and given the ever-changing landscape of Microsoft technologies, it's important dedicate time and effort to learning and building new skills.

Certifications provide great structure for exploring new technologies. While I always have an end result in mind&mdash;to achieve a particular certification&mdash;the part that I enjoy the most is more about the journey than the destination.

Ultimately, my goal is to achieve the Microsoft Certified Cybersecurity Architect Expert certification. See [Microsoft Certified: Cybersecurity Architect Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/cybersecurity-architect-expert/). I am currently studying for the Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst Associate (SC-200) exam.
