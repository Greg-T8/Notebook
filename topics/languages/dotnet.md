Expand the sections below to understand more on the topic:

<details><summary>Brief overview of .NET</summary>
There are two main flavors of .NET:

- **Legacy .NET**: refers to the .NET Framework, Mono, Xamarin, and .NET Standard
- **Modern .NET**: refers to .NET 8 and its predecessors like .NET 6 that derive from .NET Core

Modern .NET is modularized compared to the legacy .NET Framework, which is monolithic. Modern .NET is open source.

See this article for a discussion on the history of .NET: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch01-dotnet-history.md

**.NET Framework**

.NET Framework is a development platform that includes a **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**, which manages execution of code, and a **Base Class Library (BCL)**, which provides a rich library of classes to build applications from.

.NET Framework has been an official component of the Windows operating system. However, it is now considered a Windows-only and a legacy platform.  Do not create new apps using it.

**Mono, Xamarin, and Unity Projects**

Third parties developed a .NET Framework implementation named the **Mono** project. Mono is cross-platform but fell behind the official implementation of .NET Framework.

Mono has a niche as the foundation of the **Xamarin** mobile platform as well as cross-platform game development platforms like **Unity**.

Microsoft purchased Xamarin in 2016 and has integrated its functionality into Visual Studio 2022 for Mac.  

**.NET Core**

Since 2015, Microsoft has been working to rewrite the .NET Framework to be truly cross-platform. The new modernized product was initially branded **.NET Core**.  .NET Core was designed to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. .NET Core shares some components with .NET Framework but has its own runtime and set of libraries known as CoreFX. .NET Core is an open source revamp of .NET, optimized for modern application development, mainly focusing on cloud and web applications.

.NET Core includes versions up to .NET Core 3.1. 

**Modern .NET**

The term **modern .NET** refers to .NET 5 and up and its predecessors that come from .NET Core.  The term **legacy .NET** refers to the .NET Framework, Mono, and Xamarin.

Starting with .NET 5, Microsoft rebranded .NET Core as **.NET**. New versions are released each year in November.  See [.NET and .NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).

Modern .NET aims to unify .NET Core with the original .NET Framework into a single, consistent platform. Enhancements include performance improvements, more APIs, better tooling, and a range of features to support various types of development, including web, mobile (via MAUI), desktop, cloud, and IoT applications.

.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is an evolution of Xamarin.Forms and aims to simplify the development of cross-platform applications for mobile and desktop from a single codebase.

<details><summary>About .NET support</summary>

.NET versions fall in three categories:

- Long Term Support (LTS): supported by Microsoft for 3 years after General Availability, or 1 year after the next LTS release ships, whichever is longer.
- Standard Term Support (STS): Formerly known as "Current". Includes features that change based on feedback, such as the latest improvements. Supported by Microsoft 18 months after GA, or 6 months until the next STS or LTS ships, whichever is longer.
- Preview: for public testing. Not supported by Microsoft, but some Release Candidates (RC) may be declared Go Live, meaning that Microsoft supports them in production.

<details><summary>Understanding .NET runtime and .NET SDK versions</summary>

The .NET runtime is the minimum needed to install so that the system can run a .NET application. The .NET SDK includes the .NET runtime as well as the compilers and other tools needed to build .NET code and apps. The following diagram shows alignment between the major and minor numbers, but the SDK uses a separate convention for the patch number.

See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/

</details>

<details><summary>Using dotnet.exe to list and install .NET runtime and SDK versions</summary>

Use the `dotnet` command to uncover information about versions, runtimes, and SDKs.

`dotnet --version`

<img src='img/20240231-053104.png' width=150px>

`dotnet --list-sdks`

<img src='img/20240221-042115.png' width=300px>

`dotnet --list-runtimes`

<img src='img/20240222-042210.png' width=600px>

`dotnet --info`

<img src='img/20240224-042428.png' width=600px>

Use `winget search Microsoft.DotNet` to find all the available versions.

<img src='img/20240226-042627.png' width=600px>

Then use `winget install` to install a specific runtime or SDK version.

</details>

<details><summary>Understanding intermediate language</summary>

The C# compiler (named **Roslyn**) used by the `dotnet.exe` CLI tool converts C# source code into **intermediate language (IL)** code and stores the IL in an **assembly** (a DLL or EXE file). IL code statements are like assembly language instructions, which are executed by .NET's virtual machine, known as CoreCLR.

At runtime, CoreCLR loads the IL code from the assembly, the **just-in-time (JIT)** compiler compiles it into native CPU instructions, and then it is executed by the CPU on your machine.

The benefit of this two-step process is that Microsoft can create CLRs for Linux and macOS as well as for Windows.  The same IL code runs everywhere because of the second compilation step, which generates code for the native OS and CPU instruction set.

See [this ChatGPT thread](https://chat.openai.com/share/37fbe918-a6fd-470b-9ffe-ec48dd62b920) for a brief discussion on the Common Language Runtime and just-in-time compilation.

<details><summary>Visual Studio package source error</summary>

When creating a new application and building it for the first time, you may get an error like this:

<img src='img/20230656-155606.png' width=600px>

The error message is related to missing package sources from the NuGet package manager.  To fix this, open the NuGet package manager settings and verify the package source URL has been added:

<img src='img/20230658-155829.png' width=500px>

See [Visual Studio Package Sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#package-sources) for more details.

</details>

<details><summary>About top-level programs</summary>

Projects created with .NET SDK 5 or earlier always start with the following boilerplate code.

```dotnet
namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

Starting with .NET 6, Microsoft updated the project template such that new projects use the following minimal statements. These minimal statements are enabled because the required code is written for you by the compiler when you target .NET 6 or later.

```dotnet
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

The following screenshot shows how the compiler defined a hidden `Program` class with a method named `<Main>$`:  

<img src='img/20240245-064547.png' width=600px>

The only functional difference is that the auto-generated code does not define a namespace, so the `Program` class is implicitly defined in an empty namespace with no name instead of a namespace that matches the project.

The following screenshot shows how the Program class does not belong to a namespace:

<img src='img/20240256-065649.png' width=500px>

One main requirement is there can only be one file like this in a project.

See [Explore top-level statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/top-level-statements).

</details>

<details open><summary>Implicitly and globally importing namespaces</summary>

Using the statement `Console.Writeline` requires the `using System` statement at the top of the file. Traditionally, every `.cs` file that needs to import namespaces would have to start with `using` statements to import those namespaces. Namespaces like `System` and `System.Linq` are needed in almost all `.cs` files.  

C# 10 introduced the `global using` keyword combination, which means you only need to import a namespace in one `.cs` file, and it will be available throughout all `.cs` files.

You can put `global using` statements in the `Program.cs` file, but it's recommended to create a separate file for those statements. The file can be named something like `GlobalUsings.cs` and could look like:

```c#
global using global::System;
global using global::System.Linq;
global using global::System.Collections.Generic;
```

Starting with .NET 6, for any new projects, the compiler generates a `<ProjectName>.GlobalUsings.g.cs` file. Note the **g** for **generated** to differentiate it from developer-written code files. The list of implicitly imported namespaces depends on which SDK you target, e.g. `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`, `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`, `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker`.

<img src='img/20240227-042723.png' width=600px>

You can control which namespaces are implicitly imported in the project's `.csproj` file by adding the `<ItemGroup>` and `<Using>` elements: 

<img src='img/20240225-042543.png' width=400px>

Upon saving the `.csproj` file, the `GlobalUsings.cs` file is automatically updated:

<img src='img/20240224-042457.png' width=400px>

Because we imported the `Console` class, his change allows you to call methods like `WriteLine` without having to prefix them with `Console`. You can also reference the `Environment` class using its alias `Env`: 

<img src='img/20240229-042959.png' width=600px>

See the following:

- [Implicit using directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#implicit-using-directives).
- [Global and implicit usings](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-csharp-10/)

<details><summary>Visual Studio - configure startup projects</summary>

In Visual Studio, when you have multiple projects in a solution you must manually change a project as the startup project to run the application. You can avoid this behavior by setting the startup project to the current selection.

In Visual Studio, from the Solution options, click **Configure Startup Projects** and set the startup project to **Current Selection**. This makes it very easy to switch startup projects simply by clicking the project to make it the startup project.

<details><summary>Using dotnext.exe to create solutions and projects</summary>

Using `dotnet help <command>` will open a web browser with the page in the documentation about the command.

See the following page for an overview on using the `dotnet` options: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch01-project-options.md

Use `dotnet new sln` to create a new solution.

<img src='img/20240238-053807.png' width=350px>

Here are the contents of the resulting solution file:

<img src='img/20240239-053934.png' width=400px>

Use `dotnet new console` to create a new console application:

<img src='img/20240241-054101.png' width=400px>

This action creates a new file structure with the `.csproj` file:

<img src='img/20240242-054248.png' width=400px>

The previous command targets your latest .NET SDK version by default.  Use the `-f` switch to specify a target framework:

`dotnet new console -f net6.0`

Use `dotnet sln add` to add the project to the solution:

<img src='img/20240244-054454.png' width=400px>

Use `dotnet run` to compile and execute the program:

<img src='img/20240253-055306.png' width=500px>

<details><summary>Displaying inline hints</summary>

To enable assistance with explicitly-specified parameters, in Visual Studio enable the option **Display inline parameter hints**.

<img src='img/20240239-033947.png' width=450px>

Visual Studio Code has a setting with the same name.

This feature shows the names of the parameters without you having to type them.

<details><summary>C# language and features</summary>

**Public Repositories**

- [C# Language Design](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) - Includes meeting notes, proposals, and spec.
- [Compiler Implementation (Roslyn)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)

**Timeline**

- 1999: Before the first release of C#, the codename was **C-like Object-Oriented Language (COOL)**.
  - Lead architect: Anders Hejlsberg
  - Anders indicates that flaws in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which in turn drove the design of the C# language
  - "C sharp" implies that the language is an increment of C++
- 2002: C# 1 release
- 2023: C# 12

See here for a complete timeline: [C# language versions and features](https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch02-features.md) 

**Standards**

C# has also become part of several standards. However, adoption takes a long time. The language is currently at 11/12, but the latest version standard, 6.0, was released in 2015. There are drafts for 7, 8, and 9. See [Standard to describe the language](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard)

</details>

<details><summary>Specifying SDK and C# language versions</summary>

The .NET language compiler for C# is also known as **Roslyn**. There is a separate compiler for F#. Both compilers are distributed as part of the .NET SDK. To use a specific version of C#, you must have at least that version of the .NET SDK installed. The projects you create can target older versions of .NET and still use a modern compiler version. 

Use `dotnet --version` to output the SDK version:

<img src='img/20240247-034747.png' width=150px>

The SDK will use the latest supported language version by default. To target a specific language version compiler, you must add the `<LangVersion>` tag to the project configuration file (*.csproj):

<img src='img/20240252-035248.png' width=300px>

Targeting a specific language version will override the default language version that is picked from the `<TargetFramework>` tag.  

The [C# language version reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version) shows all supported C# language versions and their corresponding .NET versions.

You can also get a list of supported language versions on your system. See [this explanation](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/27101#issuecomment-1172989898) for more info. Using this technique, you can uncover the supported language versions, even for preview releases:  

<img src='img/20240259-055916.png' width=300px>

To confirm the language and compiler version, enter the following statement in a blank .cs program file and run it:  `#error version`.  You will get an error, but the error will indicate the language and compiler version. See [Override the default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version#override-the-default).
