## The Non-Designer's Design Book

Resource: [The Non-Designer's Design Book](https://a.co/d/7KWNDQa)

"The Non-Designer's Design Book" is written for individuals who need to design things but have no background or formal training in design. It specifically addresses those who find themselves tasked with design responsibilities, such as assistants required to design newsletters, volunteers creating information for congregations, small business owners crafting their own advertising, students aiming for better grades through better-looking papers, professionals seeking to enhance their presentations, teachers, statisticians, and many others who see the value in improving the layout and visual appeal of their materials. Robin Williams assumes that her readers don't have the time or interest to become design experts but would like to know how to make their work look better. The book is geared towards empowering readers with knowledge of basic design principles to enhance the visual quality and effectiveness of their projects .

### Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 1 the fundamental principles of design that are crucial for visual communication. Robin Williams shares a personal anecdote, the "Joshua tree epiphany," to illustrate the importance of being able to identify and name what you see, as naming gives you power over it and leads to conscious awareness and control. This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the four basic principles of design, which are detailed in the following chapters. These principles are:

1. **Contrast** - The idea that if two items are not the same, then they should be very different to create visual interest and direct the viewer's attention.
2. **Repetition** - The practice of repeating visual elements throughout a design to create unity and consistency.
3. **Alignment** - The concept that every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page, creating a cleaner, more sophisticated look.
4. **Proximity** - The principle of grouping related items together to organize information and reduce clutter, making the design more user-friendly and comprehensible.

Williams emphasizes that while these principles are discussed separately, they are interconnected and often applied together in practice. The chapter serves as an introduction to these concepts, setting the stage for a deeper exploration in subsequent chapters. Through this foundation, the book aims to empower readers with no formal background in design to make more professional, organized, and visually appealing design choices .

#### The Joshua Tree Epiphany

The "Joshua tree epiphany" is a personal anecdote shared by Robin Williams in Chapter 1 of "The Non-Designer's Design Book" to illustrate the power of naming and awareness in design. Williams recounts receiving a tree identification book as a Christmas gift and, after reading through it, deciding to identify the trees in her parents' neighborhood. Despite having lived there for thirteen years, she had never noticed the presence of Joshua trees until she learned to identify them from her book. Surprisingly, she found that many homes, including her parents', had Joshua trees in their front yards. This revelation struck her profoundly: only after she could name the Joshua tree did she become consciously aware of its presence everywhere around her.

<img src='img/20240345-034527.png' width=200px>

This epiphany serves as a metaphor for the principles of design that Williams aims to teach her readers. She argues that being able to name and identify design principles gives individuals power over them, transforming unconscious recognition into conscious understanding and control. By learning the names and characteristics of basic design principles, readers can begin to see their application and misapplication in the world around them, thereby gaining the ability to use those principles more effectively in their own work. The story underscores the book's premise that knowledge and awareness are key to empowering individuals to make better design choices, even if they are complete novices in the field of design.

### Chapter 2: Proximity

Chapter 2 addresses the fundamental design principle that elements related to each other should be grouped closely to form a cohesive visual unit. This principle of Proximity is essential for creating organized, clear, and visually appealing designs. 

> Proximity is really just a matter of being a little more conscious, of doing what you do naturally but pushing the concept a little harder.

> Rarely is the Principle of Proximity the only answer to a design project. The other three principles are intrinsic to the process, and you will usually find yourself using all four. But take them one at a time&mdash;start with proximity.

> Learn how to use your software so that you can make exactly the amount of space you need before and after each element; build that information into your style sheets

Here's an overview:

#### The Proximity Principle

- **Basic Idea**: Group related items together to create one visual unit, enhancing organization and communication. Be conscious of where your eye is going. This not only reduces clutter but also makes the information more accessible to the reader.
- **Purpose**: The basic purpose  of the proximity principle is to **organize**; it aims to simplify the layout by visually connecting related elements, making it easier for the viewer to understand the structure and content at a glance.

#### Proximity: Implementation

- **Physical Closeness**: The principle suggests moving physically related items closer to each other, so they are perceived as a single cohesive group rather than a collection of unrelated bits.
- **Separation of Unrelated Items**: Items or groups of information that are not related should not be placed in close proximity. This visual separation provides instant clues to the organization of the page.
- **Effective Use of Space**: By grouping items into closer proximity and adjusting space between unrelated items, the layout becomes more organized, navigable, and visually appealing.

#### Proximity: Impact on Design

- **Enhanced Clarity and Organization**: Applying the proximity principle can significantly improve the clarity and organization of a design, making it easier for the audience to understand and engage with the content.
- **Reduction of Clutter**: It helps in reducing clutter by eliminating unnecessary elements and focusing on grouping related items, which simplifies the design and enhances readability.

#### Proximity: What to Avoid

- Avoid too many separate elements on a page
- Avoid leaving equal amounts of whitespace between elements unless each group is part of a related subset
- Avoid even a split second of confusion over whether a headline, subhead, caption, graphic, or the like belongs with its related material. Create a relationship among elements with close proximity.
- Don't create relationships with elements that don't belong together!  If they are not _related_, move them apart from each other.
- Don't stick things in the corners or in the middle just because the space is empty.

#### Proximity: Design Examples

The chapter illustrates the concept with examples such as business cards and flyers, demonstrating how grouping related elements together and separating unrelated ones can drastically improve the design's effectiveness. These examples show before-and-after scenarios where applying the proximity principle clarifies the design and makes it more visually appealing.

The examples in this chapter are intentionally simple to make the point clear.

- When the numbers are closer to the information, we see the relationship of numbers to the text

> When grouping items into close proximity, you typically need to make some changes, such as in the size or weight or placement of text or graphics. Body text does not have to be 12 point! Information that is subsidiary to the main message, such as the volume number and year of a newsletter, can often be quite small.

<details><summary>Shakespeare Flyer - trapped whitespace</summary><br>

Original:

<img src='img/20240329-042923.png' width=250px>

Notes:

- The headlines are the same distance from the body copy above and below, making the heads and body copy appear as separate items
- There's lots of white space, but it's all broken up.  When white space is "trapped" like this, it tends to visually push the elements apart

Improved:

<img src='img/20240331-043158.png' width=250px>

Notes:

- Group the items that have a relationship
- If there are areas on the page where organization is not perfectly clear, see if items are in proximity that _shouldn't_ be

Find five other small differences that help make this example communicate more clearly.

<details><summary>Answer</summary><br>

1. The contact info is on separate lines&mdash;grouped together and separated&mdash;so it will stand out as important information
2. Deleted the words _phone_, _email_, and _web_ because they are unnecessary
3. Deleted the semicolon after the phone number and the last slash after the web address
4. Made the page color a little brighter
5. Made SHAKESPEARE lowercase so it is easier to read and can be set larger
6. Cropped the photo wider

- All the information is in one big chunk
- Never use all caps when there is a lot of text

Improved:

<img src='img/20240319-051905.png' width=300px>

Improvements:

- Title is not all caps
- Gave Gertrude a nicer font for her menu heading
- Removed the underlines from the subheads
- Set the names of the dishes in bold and the descriptions in regular font to help differentiate the information
- Changed all caps to title case (initial caps in each word)

Improved:

<img src='img/20240328-052822.png' width=300px>

Improvements:

- Left-hand space under each heading helps to clarify the two main groups
- Descriptive text blocks are a point size smaller thant the names of the dishes. This helps to communicate more clearly and also gives more room to work with.
- Chose a more interesting typeface than Times New Roman
- Prices were originally tucked into the text; used Principle of Alignment to make prices visibly consistent

### Chapter 3: Alignment

Alignment is about ensuring that every element on a page has a visual connection with another, aiming for a clean, organized appearance rather than a "slightly messy kitchen" effect. The principle dictates that nothing should be arbitrarily placed on the page; every item should have purpose and connection, enhancing the cohesive feel of the design.

Alignment is more than just an aesthetic choice; it serves to unify and organize the page, making the design more sophisticated and the information more accessible. By aligning elements, designers create invisible lines that connect disparate parts of a page, guiding the reader's eye in a logical flow from one element to another, even if they are not physically close. This principle is crucial not just for the aesthetic coherence of individual pages, but for multi-page documents as well, ensuring that every part of a publication feels like a piece of a whole.

> The Principle of Alignment states:  **Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.**

> A lack of alignment creates discomfort; it appears to be unorganized; we don't know how to be effective.

#### Alignment: Key Takeaways

Chapter 3 of "The Non-Designer's Design Book" focuses on the principle of alignment, highlighting its critical role in creating visually appealing and coherent designs. Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Purpose of Alignment**: Alignment is not about placing elements on the page arbitrarily but creating a visual connection between them. This principle is essential for organizing the page, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, and improving readability.

2. **Creating Order**: Proper alignment brings order to a layout, making it appear organized and professional. Every element on the page should have a visual connection with another, ensuring that the design feels cohesive and intentional.

3. **Guiding the Viewer**: Alignment helps guide the viewer's eye across the page, facilitating a logical flow from one element to the next. This invisible guiding line enhances the user's experience by making information easily accessible and understandable.

4. **Types of Alignment**: The chapter discusses the importance of choosing a consistent alignment pattern (left, right, centered, or justified) and sticking to it throughout the design to maintain coherence and unity.

    A centered alignment is the most common alignment that beginners use&mdash;it's very safe and feels comfortable. However, most designs that have a sophisticated look are not centered. As a beginner you need to break away from defaulting to centered alignment.

5. **Avoiding Misalignment**: Misalignment or arbitrary placement of elements can lead to a cluttered, disorganized appearance, making it difficult for the viewer to navigate the information. Proper alignment eliminates confusion and clutter.

    For beginners, stick to one text alignment on a page&mdash;all text is either flush left, flush right, or centered.

6. **Enhancing Visual Appeal**: Strong alignment not only organizes information effectively but also contributes to the overall visual appeal of the design. It creates a sophisticated look that attracts the viewer's attention.

7. **Application Across Multiple Pages**: For multi-page documents, alignment is crucial for maintaining a consistent look and feel across all pages, reinforcing the unity of the entire document.

8. **Invisible Connections**: Even when elements are not physically close, alignment can create invisible connections between them, suggesting a relationship and continuity that enhances the design's coherence.

#### Alignment: Examples

<details><summary>Business Card - use the invisible lines</summary><br>

Original:

<img src='img/20240332-033202.png' width=250px>

Note:

- Nothing is aligned
- There are elements with three different alignments: flush left, flush right, and centered
- The two groups of text in the upper corners are not aligned along the same baseline, nor at the left and right edges, nor with the groups at the bottom corners

Get in the habit of drawing lines between the elements to determine where connections are lacking:

<img src='img/20240337-033731.png' width=250px>

Improved:

<img src='img/20240338-033818.png' width=250px>

Note:

- Moved all elements to the right and gave them one alignment
- The text items have a common boundary
- Information is instantly more organized
- Grouping the related elements into closer proximity is also critical

<img src='img/20240341-034121.png' width=250px>

Note:

- Centered alignment appears a bit weak
- If text is aligned on the left or right, the invisible line that connects the text is much stronger because it has a hard vertical edge to follow

<img src='img/20240343-034315.png' width=250px>

Note:

- The edges are "soft"; you don't really see the strength of the line

<img src='img/20240347-034724.png' width=250px>

Note:

- The strength of this edge is what gives strength to the layout. There is a strong invisible line connecting the edges of these groups of text

<img src='img/20240332-033253.png' width=350px>

Note:

- Strong left alignment gives report cover a more sophisticated look
- Author's name is far from the title, but that invisible line connects the two text blocks

Note:

- Flush-left alignment makes the page a little more sophisticated
- Limiting the dotted line to the left opens the page and emphasizes the alignment

Improved:

<img src='img/20240338-033817.png' width=350px>

Note:

- Text is flush right, but placed on the left side
- The letter you type will have a strong flush left to align with the flush right of this layout

Improved:

Improved:

<img src='img/20240343-034338.png' width=350px>

- If you're going to center text, then at least make it obvious that it is centered!

<img src='img/20240345-034524.png' width=350px>

- Experiment with uncentering the block of centered text.

<img src='img/20240346-034635.png' width=350px>

- If you're going to center text, experiment with making it more dramatic in some way
- Sometimes you can center the type but set the block of type itself off center
- Or set the type high on the page to create more tension
- Or set a very casual, fun typeface in a very formal, centered arrangement
- Just don't set Times 12-point with double Returns!

</details>

<details><summary>O ye gods! - bad use of centered text</summary><br>

<img src='img/20240321-032115.png' width=250px>

- This layout gives "centered" a bad name: boring typeface, type that is too large, crowded text, double Returns, claustrophobic border

<img src='img/20240323-032337.png' width=250px>

- A centered alignment needs extra care to work
- This layout uses classic typeface sized fairly small
- More space betwen the lines
- Lots of white space around the text, no border

<img src='img/20240326-032615.png' width=250px>

- Emphasize a tall, slender centered layout with a tall, slender piece of paper

<img src='img/20240328-032801.png' width=250px>

- Emphasize a wide, centered layout with a wide spread

<details><summary>One Night in Winnemucca - no common alignment</summary><br>

<img src='img/20240339-033937.png' width=250px>

- Avoid using elements were there is no common alignment
- The title and byline are flush left, but the description is centered
- There is no common alignment between these two elements of text

<img src='img/20240341-034131.png' width=250px>

- These two elements still have two different alignments (top top is flush left and the bottom is flush right)
- The edge of the descriptive text below aligns with the right edge of thin rule and text above, connecting the elements with an invisible line
- Train your eyes to notice the invisible line

</details>

<details><summary>Tri-State Wellness Center - arbitrary placement </summary><br>

<img src='img/20240311-031157.png' width=400px>

- Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily
- Lack of alignment is the biggest cause of unappealing documents; our eyes like to see order
- For all vertical and horizontal alignments in this piece, all units are centered but they are not aligned with any other centered units

For any well-designed piece, you'll be able to draw lines to the aligned objects, even if the overall presentation of material is a wild collection of odd things and has lots of energy

<img src='img/20240317-031721.png' width=400px>

- Simply lining things up makes a big difference
- Not one item is on the page arbitrarily&mdash;every item has some visual connection with another item on the page
- Notice how the change in phone number positioning frees up previously-trapped whitespace
- The blue bar is added from the Principle of Repetition
- Draw shapes around the whitespace between the before and after pictures and notice how the whitespace is more organized

<details><summary>The Undiscovered Country - centered headlines problem</summary><br>


</details>

<img src='img/20240327-032719.png' width=300px>

- Many designers fail to use a subtle lack of alignment, such as centered headlines and subheads over indented paragraphs
- Headlines are centered, text is flush left, and thus the right text is "ragged"
- Paragraph indents are typewriter wide
- Never center headlines over flush left body copy or text that has an indent because if the text does not have clear left and right edges, you cannot tell that the headline is actually centered; it looks random.

<img src='img/20240330-033034.png' width=300px>

- Find a strong line and stick to it&mdash;if the text is flush left, set the heads and subheads flush left
- First paragraphs are traditionally not indented. The purpose of indenting a paragraph is to tell you there is a new paragraph, but you already know the first paragraph is a new paragraph
- The professional typographic indent is one **em**, which is about two spaces, not five. An **em** is about the point size of your type
- The columns in the picture are wide enough for the type to be justified (aligned on both sides ) without big gaps between the words
- If there are photographs or illustrations, align them with an edge and/or baseline
- Strong alignment is often the key to a professional look. Check every element to make sure it has a visual connection to something else on the page
