## The Non-Designer's Design Book

Resource: [The Non-Designer's Design Book](https://a.co/d/7KWNDQa)

"The Non-Designer's Design Book" is written for individuals who need to design things but have no background or formal training in design. It specifically addresses those who find themselves tasked with design responsibilities, such as assistants required to design newsletters, volunteers creating information for congregations, small business owners crafting their own advertising, students aiming for better grades through better-looking papers, professionals seeking to enhance their presentations, teachers, statisticians, and many others who see the value in improving the layout and visual appeal of their materials. Robin Williams assumes that her readers don't have the time or interest to become design experts but would like to know how to make their work look better. The book is geared towards empowering readers with knowledge of basic design principles to enhance the visual quality and effectiveness of their projects .

### Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 1 the fundamental principles of design that are crucial for visual communication. Robin Williams shares a personal anecdote, the "Joshua tree epiphany," to illustrate the importance of being able to identify and name what you see, as naming gives you power over it and leads to conscious awareness and control. This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the four basic principles of design, which are detailed in the following chapters. These principles are:

1. **Contrast** - The idea that if two items are not the same, then they should be very different to create visual interest and direct the viewer's attention.
2. **Repetition** - The practice of repeating visual elements throughout a design to create unity and consistency.
3. **Alignment** - The concept that every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page, creating a cleaner, more sophisticated look.
4. **Proximity** - The principle of grouping related items together to organize information and reduce clutter, making the design more user-friendly and comprehensible.

Williams emphasizes that while these principles are discussed separately, they are interconnected and often applied together in practice. The chapter serves as an introduction to these concepts, setting the stage for a deeper exploration in subsequent chapters. Through this foundation, the book aims to empower readers with no formal background in design to make more professional, organized, and visually appealing design choices .

#### The Joshua Tree Epiphany

The "Joshua tree epiphany" is a personal anecdote shared by Robin Williams in Chapter 1 of "The Non-Designer's Design Book" to illustrate the power of naming and awareness in design. Williams recounts receiving a tree identification book as a Christmas gift and, after reading through it, deciding to identify the trees in her parents' neighborhood. Despite having lived there for thirteen years, she had never noticed the presence of Joshua trees until she learned to identify them from her book. Surprisingly, she found that many homes, including her parents', had Joshua trees in their front yards. This revelation struck her profoundly: only after she could name the Joshua tree did she become consciously aware of its presence everywhere around her.

This epiphany serves as a metaphor for the principles of design that Williams aims to teach her readers. She argues that being able to name and identify design principles gives individuals power over them, transforming unconscious recognition into conscious understanding and control. By learning the names and characteristics of basic design principles, readers can begin to see their application and misapplication in the world around them, thereby gaining the ability to use those principles more effectively in their own work. The story underscores the book's premise that knowledge and awareness are key to empowering individuals to make better design choices, even if they are complete novices in the field of design.

- Repeated the bold to point out the three steps and repeated the light face to comment on them (Principle of Repetition)
- Gave the text strong alignments (Principle of Alignment)
- Separated the three steps so you can instantly see there are three of them, thus making it unnecessary to use the numerals (Principle of Proximity)

### Chapter 2: Proximity

Chapter 2 addresses the fundamental design principle that elements related to each other should be grouped closely to form a cohesive visual unit. This principle of Proximity is essential for creating organized, clear, and visually appealing designs. 

> Proximity is really just a matter of being a little more conscious, of doing what you do naturally but pushing the concept a little harder.

> Rarely is the Principle of Proximity the only answer to a design project. The other three principles are intrinsic to the process, and you will usually find yourself using all four. But take them one at a time&mdash;start with proximity.

> Learn how to use your software so that you can make exactly the amount of space you need before and after each element; build that information into your style sheets

Here's an overview:

#### The Proximity Principle

- **Basic Idea**: Group related items together to create one visual unit, enhancing organization and communication. Be conscious of where your eye is going. This not only reduces clutter but also makes the information more accessible to the reader.
- **Purpose**: The basic purpose  of the proximity principle is to **organize**; it aims to simplify the layout by visually connecting related elements, making it easier for the viewer to understand the structure and content at a glance.

#### Proximity: Implementation

- **Physical Closeness**: The principle suggests moving physically related items closer to each other, so they are perceived as a single cohesive group rather than a collection of unrelated bits.
- **Separation of Unrelated Items**: Items or groups of information that are not related should not be placed in close proximity. This visual separation provides instant clues to the organization of the page.
- **Effective Use of Space**: By grouping items into closer proximity and adjusting space between unrelated items, the layout becomes more organized, navigable, and visually appealing.

#### Proximity: Impact on Design

- **Enhanced Clarity and Organization**: Applying the proximity principle can significantly improve the clarity and organization of a design, making it easier for the audience to understand and engage with the content.
- **Reduction of Clutter**: It helps in reducing clutter by eliminating unnecessary elements and focusing on grouping related items, which simplifies the design and enhances readability.

#### Proximity: What to Avoid

- Avoid too many separate elements on a page
- Avoid leaving equal amounts of whitespace between elements unless each group is part of a related subset
- Avoid even a split second of confusion over whether a headline, subhead, caption, graphic, or the like belongs with its related material. Create a relationship among elements with close proximity.
- Don't create relationships with elements that don't belong together!  If they are not _related_, move them apart from each other.
- Don't stick things in the corners or in the middle just because the space is empty.

#### Proximity: Design Examples

The chapter illustrates the concept with examples such as business cards and flyers, demonstrating how grouping related elements together and separating unrelated ones can drastically improve the design's effectiveness. These examples show before-and-after scenarios where applying the proximity principle clarifies the design and makes it more visually appealing.

The examples in this chapter are intentionally simple to make the point clear.

Improvement:

<img src='img/20240321-032145.png' width=300px>

- When the numbers are closer to the information, we see the relationship of numbers to the text

> When grouping items into close proximity, you typically need to make some changes, such as in the size or weight or placement of text or graphics. Body text does not have to be 12 point! Information that is subsidiary to the main message, such as the volume number and year of a newsletter, can often be quite small.

<details><summary>Shakespeare Flyer</summary><br>

Original:

<img src='img/20240329-042923.png' width=250px>

Notes:

- The headlines are the same distance from the body copy above and below, making the heads and body copy appear as separate items
- There's lots of white space, but it's all broken up.  When white space is "trapped" like this, it tends to visually push the elements apart

Improved:

<img src='img/20240331-043158.png' width=250px>

Notes:

- Group the items that have a relationship
- If there are areas on the page where organization is not perfectly clear, see if items are in proximity that _shouldn't_ be

Find five other small differences that help make this example communicate more clearly.

<details><summary>Answer</summary><br>

1. The contact info is on separate lines&mdash;grouped together and separated&mdash;so it will stand out as important information
2. Deleted the words _phone_, _email_, and _web_ because they are unnecessary
3. Deleted the semicolon after the phone number and the last slash after the web address
4. Made the page color a little brighter
5. Made SHAKESPEARE lowercase so it is easier to read and can be set larger
6. Cropped the photo wider

Notes:

- All the information is in one big chunk
- Never use all caps when there is a lot of text

Improved:

<img src='img/20240319-051905.png' width=300px>

Improvements:

- Title is not all caps
- Gave Gertrude a nicer font for her menu heading
- Removed the underlines from the subheads
- Set the names of the dishes in bold and the descriptions in regular font to help differentiate the information
- Changed all caps to title case (initial caps in each word)

Improved:

<img src='img/20240328-052822.png' width=300px>

Improvements:

- Left-hand space under each heading helps to clarify the two main groups
- Descriptive text blocks are a point size smaller thant the names of the dishes. This helps to communicate more clearly and also gives more room to work with.
- Chose a more interesting typeface than Times New Roman
- Prices were originally tucked into the text; used Principle of Alignment to make prices visibly consistent

#### Summary
The proximity principle is crucial in design for creating logical, organized, and visually appealing layouts. By effectively grouping related elements and separating unrelated ones, designers can significantly improve the clarity and effectiveness of their designs. This principle, along with alignment, repetition, and contrast, forms the foundation of good design practices .
