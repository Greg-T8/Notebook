## The ADKAR Model

<details><summary>ADKAR: Overview</summary>

<br>

Successful change, at its core is rooted in how to facilitate change with one person.

The ADKAR model is a framework for managing change in businesses and organizations, developed by [Prosci](https://www.prosci.com/), a recognized leader in change management methodologies. ADKAR stands for Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. These five elements represent the linear steps individuals and organizations need to go through to successfully implement change and ensure it is sustainable over time. All five elements must be in place for a change to be realized.

Here's a brief overview of each component:

1. **Awareness** of the need for change: The first step involves creating awareness among the employees or team members about the need for change. This includes understanding the reasons behind the change, why it is necessary for the success of the organization, and the risk of not changing. Awareness also includes information about the internal and external drivers that created the need for the change, as well as "what's in it for me".

2. **Desire** to support and participate in the change: After awareness, the next step is to foster a desire among individuals to support and engage in the change effort. Desire is ultimately about personal choice, and involves personal motivation and the willingness to adapt to new ways of working.

3. **Knowledge** of how to change: Once there is a desire to change, individuals need to be equipped with the knowledge of how to change. This includes understanding the new skills (training and education), behaviors, and attitudes required to implement the change effectively.

4. **Ability** to implement required skills and behaviors: Knowledge alone is not enough; individuals must also have the ability to implement the change. This means translating knowledge into action by implementing the change to meet expectations.

5. **Reinforcement** to sustain the change: The final step is to ensure that the change is sustained over time. This involves reinforcing and embedding the changes into the organization's culture through positive feedback, rewards, and ongoing support to prevent reverting to old behaviors.

The ADKAR model is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness in guiding both individual and organizational change. It emphasizes the human side of change management, focusing on the steps individuals need to take to successfully adapt to new ways of working.

The lifecycle of ADKAR begins after a change has been identified.
