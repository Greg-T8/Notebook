This book was recommended to me by a coworker who consultants with other companies on adoption and change management practices. The notes in this page are my takeaways from reading up on adoption and change management best practices.

### Chapter 1: ADKAR: Overview

Successful change, at its core is rooted in how to facilitate change with one person.

The ADKAR model is a framework for managing change in businesses and organizations, developed by [Prosci](https://www.prosci.com/), a recognized leader in change management methodologies. ADKAR stands for Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. These five elements represent the linear steps individuals and organizations need to go through to successfully implement change and ensure it is sustainable over time. All five elements must be in place for a change to be realized.

#### Why some changes fail and others succeed

Changes fail or succeed based on how change is facilitated with individuals, not just through communications, training, project management, or vision alone. Success in change lies beyond the visible activities surrounding change efforts. It's rooted in understanding change at an individual level and addressing it through the ADKAR model's five key elements: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. These elements are the building blocks that must all be in place for a change to be successfully implemented.

Here's a brief overview of each component:

1. **Awareness** of the need for change: The first step involves creating awareness among the employees or team members about the need for change. This includes understanding the reasons behind the change, why it is necessary for the success of the organization, and the risk of not changing. Awareness also includes information about the internal and external drivers that created the need for the change, as well as "what's in it for me".

2. **Desire** to support and participate in the change: After awareness, the next step is to foster a desire among individuals to support and engage in the change effort. Desire is ultimately about personal choice, and involves personal motivation and the willingness to adapt to new ways of working.

3. **Knowledge** of how to change: Once there is a desire to change, individuals need to be equipped with the knowledge of how to change. This includes understanding the new skills (training and education), behaviors, and attitudes required to implement the change effectively.

4. **Ability** to implement required skills and behaviors: Knowledge alone is not enough; individuals must also have the ability to implement the change. This means translating knowledge into action by implementing the change to meet expectations.

5. **Reinforcement** to sustain the change: The final step is to ensure that the change is sustained over time. This involves reinforcing and embedding the changes into the organization's culture through positive feedback, rewards, and ongoing support to prevent reverting to old behaviors.

The ADKAR model is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness in guiding both individual and organizational change. It emphasizes the human side of change management, focusing on the steps individuals need to take to successfully adapt to new ways of working.

The lifecycle of ADKAR begins after a change has been identified. 

#### Chapter 1 quotes and takeaways

Here are eight important quotes from Chapter 1 of "ADKAR: A Model for Change in Business, Government, and Our Community":

1. >"Why do some changes fail while others succeed?... The secret to successful change lies beyond the visible and busy activities that surround change. Successful change, at its core, is rooted in something much simpler: How to facilitate change with one person."
2. >"The ADKAR model has five elements or objectives... All five elements must be in place for a change to be realized."
3. >"Awareness represents a person’s understanding of the nature of the change, why the change is being made and the risk of not changing."

4. >"Desire represents the willingness to support and engage in a change."
5. >"Knowledge represents the information, training and education necessary to know how to change."
6. >"Ability represents the realization or execution of the change... Ability is achieved when a person or group has the demonstrated capability to implement the change at the required performance levels."
7. >"Reinforcement represents those internal and external factors that sustain a change."
8. >"The elements of the ADKAR model fall into the natural order of how one person experiences change... Reinforcement cannot come before ability because we can only recognize and appreciate what has been achieved."

These quotes encapsulate the essence of Chapter 1, focusing on the critical components of the ADKAR model and its application to successful change management.

### Chapter 2: Awareness

Change is the foundational step in the ADKAR model, emphasizing understanding the nature of the change, its necessity, and the risks of not changing.

Chapter 2 stresses that meeting the human need to know "why" is essential for managing change effectively. Successful awareness-building requires more than just effective communication; it needs to address various factors that influence how people perceive and react to the need for change, including their view of the current state, the credibility of the message's sender, and the circulation of misinformation.

#### Example: Pineapple growers in Ghana

The book uses the example of pineapple growers in Ghana to illustrate the concept of awareness in the context of change management. The growers were initially resistant to implementing codes of practice that would improve the health and safety of their products. An awareness campaign was launched, highlighting that major buyers like UK supermarkets required code compliance as a prerequisite for purchase. This campaign also made it known that adopting these practices could lead to cost savings through reduced pesticide use. By focusing on the profitability and the risk of losing access to lucrative markets, the campaign effectively built awareness among the farmers about the need for change, demonstrating how crucial awareness is as the first step in enabling change.

#### Example: Environmental campaigns in Australia and Austria

The examples of environmental campaigns in Australia and Austria illustrate the theme of awareness by showcasing efforts to change public behavior through strategic awareness-building initiatives. In Australia, the New South Wales State Emergency Service aimed to enhance the public's readiness for storm hazards by using wide-scale information channels, including brochures, radio ads, and newspaper interviews. They also commemorated disasters with community events to highlight potential threats, aiming to motivate local actions for disaster preparedness. Similarly, in Graz, Austria, city officials sought to reduce automobile emissions by encouraging the purchase of low-emission cars and the use of alternate transportation methods. They implemented reduced parking tariffs for low-emission vehicles, visibly identifying these cars to raise public awareness about the issue. These examples underscore how creating awareness is a pivotal first step in motivating change, especially when direct control over the target audience is limited.

#### Chapter 2 quotes and takeaways

Here are seven quotes from Chapter 2 of "ADKAR: A Model for Change in Business, Government, and Our Community" with their contexts explained:

1. >"The first step to enable a change is to create awareness of the need for change. Awareness is the first element of the ADKAR model and is achieved when a person is aware of and understands the nature of the change, why it is needed and the risks of not changing."
   - This quote introduces the fundamental premise of Chapter 2, emphasizing the pivotal role of awareness in the change management process. It sets the stage for the discussion on how creating awareness is essential for any change initiative.

2. >"Pineapple growers in Ghana were resistant to implementing codes of practice for their crops... An awareness campaign was initiated to inform growers... This campaign was effective."
   - This example illustrates the practical application of awareness in effecting change. By informing the pineapple growers in Ghana about the benefits of compliance and the risks of non-compliance, the campaign successfully motivated them to adopt new codes of practice.

3. >"Meeting the human need to know 'why' is a critical factor in managing change."
   - Here, the importance of addressing the fundamental human curiosity and concern for the reasons behind a change is highlighted as a critical factor for successful change management.

4. >"In a 2005 study with 411 companies undergoing major change projects, the number one reason for resistance to change was lack of awareness of why the change was being made."
   - This finding from a study underpins the chapter's message by presenting empirical evidence on the significance of awareness (or the lack thereof) in the success or resistance of change initiatives.

5. >"Groups or individuals who attempt to implement change within the general public have the greatest challenge... The State Emergency Service used awareness-building as the first tactic in implementing change."
   - The example of the New South Wales State Emergency Service in Australia demonstrates how creating awareness among the general public can lead to successful change implementation in disaster preparedness, despite the inherent challenges of influencing a broad audience.

6. >"City officials in Graz, Austria provide an excellent example of enabling change through awareness-building with an audience over which they have no direct control."
   - This quote describes another real-world scenario where awareness-building facilitated environmental change, showcasing how strategic communication can encourage behavioral changes, such as the adoption of low-emission vehicles.

7. >"The US Environmental Protection Agency has long struggled with the public’s disposal of computer equipment... Dell will assist the EPA in addressing a major issue facing landfills."
   - This case highlights a collaborative effort between the EPA and Dell to tackle the challenge of electronic waste through awareness, illustrating the role of awareness in initiating environmental responsibility and change among the public.

### Chapter 3 - Desire

Desire is about the motivation and choice to support and engage in change. Unlike creating awareness, which can be directly influenced by providing information, fostering desire is more challenging because it involves personal choice and cannot be directly controlled. The chapter delves into factors influencing an individual's desire to support and participate in change, including the nature of the change, the organizational context, personal circumstances, and intrinsic motivators unique to each person.

The nature of the change and its impact on individuals play a critical role in fostering desire. How a person perceives the organization and the change environment, as well as their personal situation (e.g., family status, financial security, career aspirations), also influence their willingness to support change. Additionally, what motivates an individual—such as the desire to help others, avoid negative consequences, or seek advancement—significantly affects their engagement in the change process.

By understanding these factors, change leaders and managers can better design and implement strategies that address the unique challenges within their organizations, encouraging individuals to support and participate in change initiatives. The ADKAR model uses desire as a key component to ensure that change is not only understood but also embraced by those it affects .

#### Desire - Illustrated Examples

Chapter 3 provides specific examples to illustrate how the concept of desire plays out in various change scenarios. These examples include:

1. **Pineapple Growers in Ghana**: This example highlights how awareness of a change and understanding its benefits can influence desire. Pineapple growers were resistant to implementing new codes of practice until an awareness campaign informed them of the potential for increased profitability and access to premium markets like the UK. The campaign focused on the benefits of reduced pesticide use and compliance with international standards, ultimately influencing the growers' desire to adopt the new practices.

2. **Lance Armstrong's Decision**: The case of Lance Armstrong's decision to attempt a 7th Tour de France victory is used to discuss the factors that contribute to the desire to change. This example explores how the nature of the challenge, personal and environmental context, personal situation, and intrinsic motivators worked together to influence Armstrong's desire to compete again.

These examples serve to illustrate the complexity of desire in the context of change management. They show that desire is influenced by a variety of factors, including personal motivation, the perceived benefits of the change, the organizational or environmental context, and an individual's personal situation. Understanding these factors can help change leaders design more effective strategies to foster desire among individuals and groups undergoing change.

#### Desire - Key Takeways

The key takeaways from Chapter 3 - Desire, of "ADKAR: A Model for Change in Business, Government, and Our Community" include:

1. **Nature of Change and Personal Impact**: Understanding the specific nature of the change and how it directly impacts individuals is crucial in fostering the desire to support and participate in the change. The "What's in it for me?" (WIIFM) aspect is significant in driving personal motivation.

2. **Organizational Context**: The perception of the organization and the environment in which the change occurs influences individuals' desire to support the change. Past experiences, culture, and the current state of change initiatives within the organization all play a role.

3. **Personal Situation**: An individual's personal context, including their current life situation, career aspirations, and personal values, significantly affects their desire to embrace change. This includes factors such as family commitments, financial stability, and personal goals.

4. **Intrinsic Motivation**: The internal motivators that are unique to each individual, such as the desire for personal growth, achievement, or the need to avoid negative outcomes, are key drivers of desire. Understanding these motivators can help tailor change management strategies to better engage individuals.

5. **Limited Control Over Desire**: Unlike awareness, which can be increased through information dissemination, desire involves a personal choice and is inherently more challenging to influence directly. Change leaders must recognize this and focus on creating conditions that enhance individuals' willingness to change.

6. **Importance of Addressing Individual Needs and Concerns**: Effective change management strategies must consider and address the unique needs, concerns, and motivators of individuals to successfully foster the desire to change. This may involve personalized communication, addressing specific concerns, and highlighting benefits relevant to individual situations.

7. **Foundation for Subsequent ADKAR Elements**: Desire is a critical foundation for the subsequent elements of the ADKAR model (Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement). Without a genuine desire to support and participate in change, the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, skill development, and reinforcement strategies can be compromised.

In summary, Chapter 3 emphasizes that fostering desire is a complex but essential part of the change process, requiring a deep understanding of individual motivations, organizational context, and the specific impacts of the change on those involved.

#### Desire - Notable Quotes

From Chapter 3, here are several notable quotes that encapsulate key insights and advice regarding fostering desire for change:

1. **"Desire represents the motivation and ultimate choice to support and participate in a change."** - This quote underscores the essence of 'Desire' in the ADKAR model, highlighting it as a pivotal choice and motivation driving change participation.

2. **"Unlike awareness-building, where we can take definitive steps to generate awareness of the need for change, creating the desire to change remains elusive and, by definition, not under our direct control."** - This emphasizes the complex nature of desire, distinguishing it from the more straightforward process of raising awareness.

3. **"A common mistake made by many business leaders is to assume that by building awareness of the need for change they have also created desire."** - This points out a common pitfall in change management efforts, emphasizing the need to address desire as a distinct and critical element of successful change.

4. **"Understanding the underlying factors that influence an individual's desire to change is an important first step to achieving this element of the ADKAR model."** - This highlights the importance of understanding personal motivations and circumstances in fostering desire for change.

5. **"What drives each of us to change is unique and falls along a broad spectrum of motivators."** - This quote recognizes the individualized nature of motivation and its crucial role in the desire to change.

6. **"Each person has a unique capacity to change."** - Here, the emphasis is on the individual differences in how people respond to change, underscoring the need for personalized approaches in change management.

These quotes from Chapter 3 encapsulate the nuanced understanding of desire within the context of change management, emphasizing its complexity, the importance of individual motivations, and the challenges it presents in fostering successful change initiatives.

### Chapter 4 - Knowledge

This chapter emphasizes that knowledge is crucial for implementing change, encompassing the necessary training, education, skills, behaviors, processes, systems, tools, job roles, and techniques required for change. It outlines how once individuals are aware of the need for change and possess the desire to support it, acquiring knowledge is the next step towards realizing that change.

The chapter presents knowledge as including:

- Training and education on the skills and behaviors needed to change.
- Detailed information on how to use new processes, systems, and tools.
- Understanding of new roles and responsibilities associated with the change.

An example provided in the chapter is the "Green" Hotels Association's initiative to change how hotel guests treated bath towels, showcasing how simple education and awareness can lead to significant, widespread changes.

Knowledge is positioned as an essential building block for change, following awareness and desire within the ADKAR model. It's highlighted that knowledge alone does not guarantee the ability to implement change, indicating the distinction between knowing how to do something and actually being able to do it effectively. This sets the stage for discussing the next element in the ADKAR model, Ability, underscoring the progression from knowledge to the demonstration of capability.

#### Knowledge - Illustrated Examples

Chapter 4 discusses the initiative by the "Green" Hotels Association to change how hotel guests treat bath towels. This initiative aimed to promote environmental conservation by encouraging guests to reuse towels instead of requesting new ones daily. The association achieved this by placing cards in hotel rooms that educated guests about the environmental impact of washing towels after a single use and provided clear instructions on how guests could participate in the conservation effort. The cards communicated that leaving a towel hanging means "I will use it again," while a towel left on the floor signifies "Please exchange." This simple yet effective communication strategy provided guests with the knowledge needed to change their behavior, demonstrating how awareness and knowledge can lead to actionable change.

This example illustrates how providing clear, concise information and instructions can empower individuals to make informed decisions and adopt new behaviors that support change initiatives. It underscores the importance of knowledge as a critical element of the ADKAR model, bridging the gap between the desire to support a change and the ability to implement it effectively.[]

#### Knowledge - Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from Chapter 4 - Knowledge, of "ADKAR: A Model for Change in Business, Government, and Our Community" are:

1. **Definition of Knowledge in Change**: Knowledge within the context of change management is defined as the information, training, and education necessary to understand how to make the change happen. It's about acquiring the skills, behaviors, and understanding needed to implement new processes, systems, tools, roles, and responsibilities effectively.

2. **Knowledge as a Building Block for Change**: Following awareness of the need for change and the desire to participate in change, knowledge is the crucial next step that enables individuals to move from wanting to change to knowing how to change. It bridges the gap between the theoretical understanding of why change is necessary and the practical ability to implement change.

3. **Essential for Implementation**: Knowledge is essential for the successful implementation of change. Without the necessary knowledge, individuals may be willing but unable to support and engage in change initiatives effectively.

4. **Does Not Guarantee Ability**: The chapter emphasizes that knowledge alone does not guarantee the ability to implement change. There is a distinction between knowing how to do something and having the capability to do it at the required performance levels. This sets the stage for discussing "Ability," the next element in the ADKAR model.

5. **Importance of Tailored Training and Education**: Effective training and education are critical for building knowledge. These efforts must be tailored to the specific needs of the change initiative and the individuals involved to ensure that the right skills and information are conveyed.

6. **The Role of Examples in Understanding Knowledge**: The use of examples, such as the "Green" Hotels Association's initiative, illustrates how providing knowledge can lead to practical changes in behavior. These examples demonstrate the power of effective communication and education in facilitating change.

7. **Progression in the ADKAR Model**: Knowledge serves as a bridge in the ADKAR model, connecting the initial psychological steps of awareness and desire with the practical steps of ability and reinforcement. It underscores the progression from being aware and wanting to change, to knowing how to change, and ultimately being able to implement the change successfully.

These takeaways highlight the importance of knowledge in the change management process and its role in equipping individuals with the necessary tools and understanding to support and participate in change initiatives.

#### Knowledge - Notable Quotes

Here are some notable quotes from Chapter 4 that highlight key insights on the importance of knowledge in the change management process:
