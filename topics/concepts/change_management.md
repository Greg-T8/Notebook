## The ADKAR Model

This book was recommended to me by a coworker who consultants with other companies on adoption and change management practices. The notes in this page are my takeaways from reading up on adoption and change management best practices.

### Chapter 1: ADKAR: Overview

Successful change, at its core is rooted in how to facilitate change with one person.

The ADKAR model is a framework for managing change in businesses and organizations, developed by [Prosci](https://www.prosci.com/), a recognized leader in change management methodologies. ADKAR stands for Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. These five elements represent the linear steps individuals and organizations need to go through to successfully implement change and ensure it is sustainable over time. All five elements must be in place for a change to be realized.

#### Why some changes fail and others succeed

Changes fail or succeed based on how change is facilitated with individuals, not just through communications, training, project management, or vision alone. Success in change lies beyond the visible activities surrounding change efforts. It's rooted in understanding change at an individual level and addressing it through the ADKAR model's five key elements: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. These elements are the building blocks that must all be in place for a change to be successfully implemented.

Here's a brief overview of each component:

1. **Awareness** of the need for change: The first step involves creating awareness among the employees or team members about the need for change. This includes understanding the reasons behind the change, why it is necessary for the success of the organization, and the risk of not changing. Awareness also includes information about the internal and external drivers that created the need for the change, as well as "what's in it for me".

2. **Desire** to support and participate in the change: After awareness, the next step is to foster a desire among individuals to support and engage in the change effort. Desire is ultimately about personal choice, and involves personal motivation and the willingness to adapt to new ways of working.

3. **Knowledge** of how to change: Once there is a desire to change, individuals need to be equipped with the knowledge of how to change. This includes understanding the new skills (training and education), behaviors, and attitudes required to implement the change effectively.

4. **Ability** to implement required skills and behaviors: Knowledge alone is not enough; individuals must also have the ability to implement the change. This means translating knowledge into action by implementing the change to meet expectations.

5. **Reinforcement** to sustain the change: The final step is to ensure that the change is sustained over time. This involves reinforcing and embedding the changes into the organization's culture through positive feedback, rewards, and ongoing support to prevent reverting to old behaviors.

The ADKAR model is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness in guiding both individual and organizational change. It emphasizes the human side of change management, focusing on the steps individuals need to take to successfully adapt to new ways of working.

The lifecycle of ADKAR begins after a change has been identified. 

#### Chapter 1 quotes and takeaways

Here are ten important quotes from Chapter 1 of "ADKAR: A Model for Change in Business, Government, and Our Community":

1. >"Why do some changes fail while others succeed?... The secret to successful change lies beyond the visible and busy activities that surround change. Successful change, at its core, is rooted in something much simpler: How to facilitate change with one person."
2. >"The ADKAR model has five elements or objectives... All five elements must be in place for a change to be realized."
3. >"Awareness represents a person’s understanding of the nature of the change, why the change is being made and the risk of not changing."

4. >"Desire represents the willingness to support and engage in a change."
5. >"Knowledge represents the information, training and education necessary to know how to change."
6. >"Ability represents the realization or execution of the change... Ability is achieved when a person or group has the demonstrated capability to implement the change at the required performance levels."
7. >"Reinforcement represents those internal and external factors that sustain a change."
8. >"The elements of the ADKAR model fall into the natural order of how one person experiences change... Reinforcement cannot come before ability because we can only recognize and appreciate what has been achieved."

The last two quotes (9 and 10) reflect placeholder quotes due to a misunderstanding in the request's fulfillment. Let's correct this with additional meaningful insights from Chapter 1:

9. >"The ADKAR model is a simple yet powerful tool for driving change successfully by addressing the essential human elements that inspire true transformation." (Paraphrased for context and relevance)
10. >"Understanding and addressing individual transitions is crucial because organizational change only happens when people change." (Paraphrased for context and relevance)

These quotes encapsulate the essence of Chapter 1, focusing on the critical components of the ADKAR model and its application to successful change management.

### Chapter 2: Awareness

Change is the foundational step in the ADKAR model, emphasizing understanding the nature of the change, its necessity, and the risks of not changing.

Chapter 2 stresses that meeting the human need to know "why" is essential for managing change effectively. Successful awareness-building requires more than just effective communication; it needs to address various factors that influence how people perceive and react to the need for change, including their view of the current state, the credibility of the message's sender, and the circulation of misinformation.

#### Example: Pineapple growers in Ghana

The book uses the example of pineapple growers in Ghana to illustrate the concept of awareness in the context of change management. The growers were initially resistant to implementing codes of practice that would improve the health and safety of their products. An awareness campaign was launched, highlighting that major buyers like UK supermarkets required code compliance as a prerequisite for purchase. This campaign also made it known that adopting these practices could lead to cost savings through reduced pesticide use. By focusing on the profitability and the risk of losing access to lucrative markets, the campaign effectively built awareness among the farmers about the need for change, demonstrating how crucial awareness is as the first step in enabling change.

#### Example: Environmental campaigns in Australia and Austria

The examples of environmental campaigns in Australia and Austria illustrate the theme of awareness by showcasing efforts to change public behavior through strategic awareness-building initiatives. In Australia, the New South Wales State Emergency Service aimed to enhance the public's readiness for storm hazards by using wide-scale information channels, including brochures, radio ads, and newspaper interviews. They also commemorated disasters with community events to highlight potential threats, aiming to motivate local actions for disaster preparedness. Similarly, in Graz, Austria, city officials sought to reduce automobile emissions by encouraging the purchase of low-emission cars and the use of alternate transportation methods. They implemented reduced parking tariffs for low-emission vehicles, visibly identifying these cars to raise public awareness about the issue. These examples underscore how creating awareness is a pivotal first step in motivating change, especially when direct control over the target audience is limited.

#### Chapter 2 quotes and takeaways

Here are seven quotes from Chapter 2 of "ADKAR: A Model for Change in Business, Government, and Our Community" with their contexts explained:

1. >"The first step to enable a change is to create awareness of the need for change. Awareness is the first element of the ADKAR model and is achieved when a person is aware of and understands the nature of the change, why it is needed and the risks of not changing."
   - This quote introduces the fundamental premise of Chapter 2, emphasizing the pivotal role of awareness in the change management process. It sets the stage for the discussion on how creating awareness is essential for any change initiative.

2. >"Pineapple growers in Ghana were resistant to implementing codes of practice for their crops... An awareness campaign was initiated to inform growers... This campaign was effective."
   - This example illustrates the practical application of awareness in effecting change. By informing the pineapple growers in Ghana about the benefits of compliance and the risks of non-compliance, the campaign successfully motivated them to adopt new codes of practice.

3. >"Meeting the human need to know 'why' is a critical factor in managing change."
   - Here, the importance of addressing the fundamental human curiosity and concern for the reasons behind a change is highlighted as a critical factor for successful change management.

4. >"In a 2005 study with 411 companies undergoing major change projects, the number one reason for resistance to change was lack of awareness of why the change was being made."
   - This finding from a study underpins the chapter's message by presenting empirical evidence on the significance of awareness (or the lack thereof) in the success or resistance of change initiatives.

5. >"Groups or individuals who attempt to implement change within the general public have the greatest challenge... The State Emergency Service used awareness-building as the first tactic in implementing change."
   - The example of the New South Wales State Emergency Service in Australia demonstrates how creating awareness among the general public can lead to successful change implementation in disaster preparedness, despite the inherent challenges of influencing a broad audience.

6. >"City officials in Graz, Austria provide an excellent example of enabling change through awareness-building with an audience over which they have no direct control."
   - This quote describes another real-world scenario where awareness-building facilitated environmental change, showcasing how strategic communication can encourage behavioral changes, such as the adoption of low-emission vehicles.

7. >"The US Environmental Protection Agency has long struggled with the public’s disposal of computer equipment... Dell will assist the EPA in addressing a major issue facing landfills."
   - This case highlights a collaborative effort between the EPA and Dell to tackle the challenge of electronic waste through awareness, illustrating the role of awareness in initiating environmental responsibility and change among the public.
